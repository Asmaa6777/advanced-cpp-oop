Think of classes as the blueprint for a house :
(a detailed plan, technical drawing, or guide for making something).
It defines where the walls go and what the features are, but no one can live in it yet.
Here is comes the The Object: the actual houses built from that blueprint. 

Unlike structured programming, which separates data from the operations
that act upon it, OOP integrates data (attributes) and behaviour (operations)
into a single fundamental unit called the Object.
