/** 

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that involves bundling data and methods together within a class, 
while restricting direct access to some of the class's components.
This is typically achieved using access specifiers such as :
public, private, and protected.
1. public -> accessible outside the class
2. private -> accessible only inside the class
3. protected -> will be discussed later (after inheritance)
